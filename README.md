# AngularMomentumSimplification
Mathematica package mainly for simplifying sums over Clebsch-Gordan coefficients / 3j-symbols into sums over 6j and 9j symbols

Code is documented in the mathematica notebook AngularMomentum_examples.nb
This code has been written with Mathematica 10 and does not work with older or newer versions.
It is not actively maintained, I will not fix issues with newer Mathematica versions.
