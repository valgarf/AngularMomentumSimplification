- Documentation AngularMomentum` package 
	-> AngularMomentum_examples.nb "Behind the Scenes" section
- Implementing 9j symbols
- Implementing rules that result in a new sum, e.g. sum[f[x,y,z],x,y] :> sum[g[x,y,z],z]
	Chose constant? Add to integerQN / halfintegerQN lists? What about rules that make the expression more complex?
- fix consistencyCheck bug
- fix similar named symbols bug
- exploit information of conZero[a,b,0] (a=-b)

KNOWN ISSUES:

- UnitTesting: initialiseTests[]
	Never finishes when evaluating a second time. Aborting and reevaluating the cell solves it.

- AngularMomentum: Loading package (<<AngularMomentum`)
	Never finishes when evaluating a second time. Aborting and reevaluating the cell solves it.

- AngularMomentum: simplifyAMSum
	Takes a very long time (forever?) to ensure that no pattern can match. If a match exists it is usually quite fast.
	This results in the function never finishing, as the final result might be to complex to check...
	Maybe using some kind of time limit?

- AngularMomentum: simplifyAMSum
	Complains about missing information (symbol X has not been declared) but still works and produces incorrect results (usually the factors are wrong).
	Abort after error messages? Warn about incorrect result? Search for reason for incorrect results?

- AngularMomentum: consistencyCheck
	does not identify numbers, e.g. 0

- AngularMomentum: simplifyAMSum
	identical symbols with and without indices cause problems, e.g. t[1], t[2] and t
	especially KroneckerDelta[t,X] KroneckerDelta[t[1],Y] sometimes results in KroneckerDelta[X[1],Y]
